# Changelog

All notable MewMobile changes are recorded here. GitHub release notes use the same
user-facing summary so the in-app updater can display it before download.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a MewMobile first-launch setup guide explaining optional metadata, CloudStream providers, and external integrations.
- Added a dedicated MewMobile Beta GitHub Actions release path for prerelease validation.

### Changed

- Rebranded visible default-locale and localized product references from Nuvio to MewMobile.
- Rewrote the project README around MewMobile's external-integration architecture.
- Updated stable release workflow naming and corrected the iOS artifact handoff name.


## 0.4.14 - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Added privacy-safe runtime diagnostics and persistent local crash reports with
  a dedicated copy action under Nuvio Enhanced system settings.
- Added optional cinematic detail headers, richer production and network
  information, regional streaming-provider availability, and expanded series
  statistics.
- Added custom profile backgrounds with resilient loading, theme-matched
  supporter presets, and refreshed profile and startup presentation.

### Improved

- Metadata requests now share cached work, avoid duplicate loading, and enforce
  bounded initial loading while optional enrichment continues into the cache.
- Episode playback now reuses cached video identifiers, and stream requests
  handle cancellation, replacement, provider failures, and timeouts more safely.
- Plugin repositories now store scraper code separately, consolidate local
  persistence, and isolate refreshes between profiles for substantially lower
  memory usage with large repositories.
- Improved detail-page layouts, episode navigation, Home refresh behavior,
  keyboard focus, hero trailer playback, and release artwork fallbacks.
- Improved Simkl progress reconciliation, transient scrobble retries, watched
  episode transitions, and protection against stale provider snapshots.

### Fixed

- Fixed metadata text and artwork changing repeatedly while a detail page was
  loading or after late enrichment completed.
- Fixed stream screens becoming stuck in loading states or showing results from
  an older title, episode, or profile.
- Fixed out-of-memory failures when loading and persisting large plugin scraper
  repositories.
- Fixed supporter theme backgrounds not following the selected theme. Explicit
  custom background images remain unchanged when switching themes.
- Fixed stale remote profile data replacing valid local backgrounds and improved
  custom-background recovery after returning to the foreground.
- Hardened Android and iOS crash reporting so diagnostics cannot replace the
  original failure or expose private identifiers, URLs, tokens, or email
  addresses.

Enhanced settings remain preserved when updating from an earlier release.

### Release

- This release is based on official NuvioMobile `0.4.11` and is versioned
  independently as Nuvio Enhanced `0.4.14 (118)`.

## 0.4.13 - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Restored AniList and MyAnimeList client configuration in public Android builds.
- Added release validation for the AniList, MyAnimeList, Premiumize, and Simkl
  Client IDs so a build cannot be published with those integrations disabled.

Enhanced settings remain preserved when updating from an earlier release.

### Release

### Changed

- Integrated the official Nuvio `0.4.4` codebase while retaining Enhanced
  features and adopting the current Trakt and Simkl tracking architecture.

  known npm audit vulnerabilities.

  instead of presenting an artificial zero-percent target.
