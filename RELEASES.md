# Android release setup

## Trakt

Create a Trakt API application and use this redirect URI:

```text
nuvioenhanced://auth/trakt
```

For local builds, add these values to `local.properties`:

```properties
TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
TRAKT_REDIRECT_URI=nuvioenhanced://auth/trakt
```

For GitHub Actions releases, add repository secrets named:

- `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`
- `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET`

The workflow passes the secrets directly to Gradle and does not print their values.
Forks do not inherit Actions secrets, so every fork that publishes an APK must
configure its own credentials.

## Simkl

Create a Simkl API application and use this redirect URI:

```text
nuvioenhanced://auth/simkl
```

For local builds, add these values to `local.properties`:

```properties
SIMKL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SIMKL_REDIRECT_URI=nuvioenhanced://auth/simkl
SIMKL_APP_NAME=Mew
```

For GitHub Actions releases, add the repository secret `SIMKL_CLIENT_ID`.
Simkl authentication uses PKCE and does not embed a client secret in the app.

## Android signing

An APK can update an existing Mew installation only when both APKs
use the same application ID and signing certificate. The established Android
certificate SHA-256 digest is:

```text
4d87e3d92c54ae0efcdebb75dd08b8cfca1eace052198ed3b8f3f552533a21e3
```

The repository owner must configure the Mew signing material through
`MEW_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `MEW_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
`MEW_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, and `MEW_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`. Never commit the
keystore or its passwords, and do not send them through chat.

Legacy `NUVIO_*` signing/update identifiers may remain in compatibility paths
where changing them would break existing installations or release tooling.

The release workflow verifies every generated APK against this digest before
uploading artifacts or creating a GitHub Release. A mismatch stops the workflow
because that APK would require users to uninstall the existing app.

## Update source

GitHub Actions builds automatically use the owner of the repository running the
workflow. A local build can override the update source in `local.properties`:

```properties
MEW_UPDATE_GITHUB_OWNER=somilkhan
MEW_UPDATE_GITHUB_REPO=MewMobile
```

The updater targets `somilkhan/MewMobile` for Mew releases. Legacy updater
properties may remain supported for compatibility with existing installations.

The app checks published, non-prerelease GitHub Releases at startup. A release is
offered only when it contains a compatible APK and has a version newer than the
installed app. The GitHub release body is displayed as the in-app changelog.

## Release checklist

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the current Mew release identity.
2. Increment `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in
   `iosApp/Configuration/Version.xcconfig`.
3. Build and test `fullRelease`.
4. Confirm the release contents with the repository owner.
5. Run the Android release workflow in `publish` mode.
